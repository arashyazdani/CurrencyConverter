This is an Currency Converter API test.

A little AI has been imported in this project. When you call the Convert API these actions will be done:

1- If we have the Rate converting will be done.

2- If we have the inverted Rate, it will be inverted and registered in database and then converting will be done.

3- If we have one of the currency rate in database, it will be looking for same rates in right or left columns and then register obtained the Rate formula and converting will be done.

Please import "CurrencyConverter.postman_collection" file to Postman if you need and enjoy it.

Everybody can use this project and improve it for individual use.

Best regards
