This is a Currency Converter API test.

A little (AI) has been imported into this project. When you call the Convert API, these actions will be performed:

1- If we have the rate, the conversion will be done.

2- If we have the inverted rate, it will be inverted and registered in the database and then the conversion will be done.

3- If we have one of the currency rates in our database, it will look for the same rates in the right or left columns and then register the obtainedÂ rate formula and conversion will be done.

Please import the "CurrencyConverter.postman_collection" file into Postman if you need it and enjoy.

Everybody can use this project and improve it.

Best regards
